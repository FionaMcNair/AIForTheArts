    "## Final Notebook: Reflective Planner – A Weekly AI Check-In & Planning Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflective Planner** is a student-focused tool that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to turn weekly tasks and moods into personalised and emotionally intelligent plans. It blends productivity with wellbeing, encouraging students to approach their week with structure and self-compassion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users input a short to-do list and a description of how they feel. The LLM responds with a gentle breakdown of tasks, encouragement, and mindful reminders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project concept resonates with me on a personal level, as it would for many other students, as I often find myself balancing deadlines, expectations, work commitments and a lack of motivation all at once. The concept of a planner that supports both productivity and emotional wellbeing felt especially relevant during this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing this tool made me think about how AI can be used to encourage self-compassion while still helping us stay on track - something I think many students could benefit from."
